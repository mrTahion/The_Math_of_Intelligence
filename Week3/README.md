# L1 and L2 Regularization with Linear Regression model
An implementation of L1 and L2 Normalization with linear regression in numpy.

## Introduction
Using the [Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data](https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) dataset from Kaggle, goal is to implement L1 and L2 Normalization to regularize a linear model, and make a comparison between the performance of L1 and L2.

## Requirements
* python3
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
